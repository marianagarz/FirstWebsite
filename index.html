	    I take many classes and I like them all very medium. Below is a list of all my letter classes.
	  </p>
	  
	  <ol>
	    <li> Accelerated Physics - A block </li>
		<li> U.S. and the world -B block </li>
		<li> Advanced Computer Science/T.I.D.E- C block </li>
		<li> Poetry-D block</li>
		<li> Accelerated Calc- E block</li>
		<li> Spanish Four -F block </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    BUT that is not all- I also take a very fair ammount of L block classes.
		When we were signing up for our classes I was under the impression it was a 
		rate your picks 1-5 situation, turns out it was mark the classes you want 
		to take... <br><br>And admittedly at the beginning of the year I didn't drop any 
		becase I was convinced that they would all be extreemly riviting and worth the 
		lost hour of sleep. I'm not saying they are not interesting, but I have a very fair
		number of lates... Anyway L block classes are as follows.
	  </p>
	  
	  <ul>
	    <li> Photoshop </li> 
		<li> Yoga </li> 
		<li> Social Justice Divercity Practicioner training </li>
		<li> Physics lab </li>
	  </ul>
